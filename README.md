# React State Examples

> TODO: I put this together in a few hours; it needs polish

This is a teaching exercise for students to build some basic React examples that require managing state.

This project is written using [re-frame] so students can't copy the code :laughing:

Their goal is to re-implement the logic using [create-react-app] and vanilla React components with `state` and `props`

The built application can be seen here: https://oakmac.com/react-state-examples/
